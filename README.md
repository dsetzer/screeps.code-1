## ScreepsOCS/screeps.code

This is the main OCS screeps AI, formerly known as *screeps.behaviour-action-pattern*. 

There is also an [extension repo](https://github.com/ScreepsOCS/screeps.code.extension) with advanced code, formerly known as *screeps.ocs.internal*, which extends this repo, overriding some of the code. 

You may want to use the [package repo](https://github.com/ScreepsOCS/screeps.code.package) for merging both repos plus your custom overrides and additions. It also offers screeps deployment and some advanced functionalities.
